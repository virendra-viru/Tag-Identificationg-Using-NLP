# Tag Identificationg Using NLP
 This projects applies NLP to identify the TAG details...

Description:
This project aims to demonstrate tag identification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Specifically, we extract information from a webpage (in this case, the Wikipedia page on "Apple") and identify relevant keywords or tags from the text. This process involves parsing HTML content, tokenization, removing stopwords, and frequency analysis to determine the most significant terms.

Implementation Steps:

URL Handling and HTML Parsing: Utilize libraries like urllib and BeautifulSoup to fetch and parse HTML content from the target webpage.

Tokenization: Tokenize the text into individual words or tokens to prepare for further analysis.

Stopword Removal: Remove stopwords (common words like "the", "is", "and", etc.) from the tokenized text using the NLTK library's stopwords corpus.

Frequency Analysis: Perform frequency analysis on the cleaned tokens to identify the most frequent terms in the text.

Visualization: Visualize the frequency distribution of terms using tools like Matplotlib to gain insights into the most significant keywords.
